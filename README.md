# noTunes

noTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes _or_ Apple Music from launching.

Simply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music will no longer be able to launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones reconnect to a laptop which may trigger iTunes/Music to open.

You can enable/disable the apps functionality via the menu bar icon, which is a simple toggle.
